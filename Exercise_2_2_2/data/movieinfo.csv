Using interviews with friends and colleagues, and original and re-enacted footage of Sherman's performances, this film explores the life, death, disappearance and rediscovery of this utterly unique artist. Described by one writer as 'the Buster Keaton of linguistics', Sherman's art defied neat categories and simple explanation. The same could be said of Sherman himself, who as a person was a notoriously secretive individual. From this perspective, the film asks viewer to question their understanding of how a life story can be told relative to the private nature of its subject."

Without any hard evidence, he chooses to interrogate the three accused suspects.

1965698,plot,"Biopic about famed Canadian pot activist Marc Emery, who is currently serving 5 years in a US penitentiary for selling marijuana seeds to Americans over the Internet. Unlike virtually all materials on Emery, which see him as a martyr and champion of Canadian sovereignty, CITIZEN MARC looks at Emery as a deluded narcissist who has engaged in 'Tea Party' style pro-capitalist, anti-government fights of often silly proportions. The film questions whether Emery, in his headlong quest for fame and jail and his fight against government, generated some kind of meaningful and progressive political energy in the process."
1965698,plot,"A documentary about famed marijuana legalization activist, Marc Emery, the self-styled 'Prince of Pot'. In 2005 Emery was arrested by the U.S. DEA, charged with trafficking pot seeds over the Internet and convicted of international drug trafficking. A Canadian citizen, Emery was extradited to the U.S. to serve five years in federal prison. In Canada at that time, the penalty for selling marijuana seeds was a fine. But Emery's incarceration, this film suggests, does not constitute a simple miscarriage of justice. It rather fulfills Emery's complex, often narcissistic vision of himself as a fierce libertarian and quasi-biblical prophet whose destiny is to defeat government. Citizen Marc wittily questions what it means to be a citizen in a post-identity, post-equality North America."

1825288,plot,"Alf Randell is a self-described 'dirtbag' who has spent nearly a decade of his life living and climbing amongst the soaring sandstone cliffs of Indian Creek, Utah. He has no job, no bank account, and no house save the rickety camper perched atop his pickup truck. Sometimes climbing is more than a hobby or a priority; it is a calling. A Desert Life is a portrait of a man who truly lives his passion, and a tribute to the enchanting desert he calls home. It is the first film from 24-year-old director Austin Siadak, who quit his desk job in the spring of 2011 to embrace his own calling for climbing and adventure on a road trip across the American West."

Michael Seyfert delivers a high-minded, yet unsettling documentary, starring an antagonistic worm, a deliciously visceral character, a quixotic drug dealer, who aside from some cliche-guevarian meandering, comes across surprisingly rational. A passionate post modern run-away slave introducing us to his life as a decomposer, the last link in the Brazilian food chain, while dodging bullets and righteous violence of Rio's militarized police force."

1859022,goofs,"CONT: The ""coloring"" that the chipmunks did on Dave's presentation posters depicted Simon with glasses. But the drawings were done before it was discovered that he needed glasses."
1859022,goofs,"CONT: In the scene after Dave loses his job he writes a letter explaining that things aren't working out, and prepares a box for the chipmunks. He closes the box and pokes five random holes in the top. Moments later he changes his mind, and goes to the closet to put the box away on a high shelf. As he lifts it, you can clearly see seven neatly spaced holes."
1859022,goofs,"CONT: In the kitchen cupboard scene, Theodore chews a large hole in a box of Lucky Charms and eats some of the cereal. Seconds later Alvin dumps the bag of cheese balls on Theodore and the Lucky Charms box can be seen again without a hole chewed in it."

1859022,goofs,"FAIR: When Claire is taking pictures of the Chipmunks at the party you can see a flash go off directly at them, even though Claire's camera doesn't have a flash attached. However, the Chipmunks are being flashed at every few seconds throughout the scene, even before Claire comes to their table, and after she leaves as well.

1859022,plot,"In a tree farm, three musically inclined chipmunks, Alvin, Simon and Theodore, find their tree cut down and sent to Los Angeles. Once there, they meet the frustrated songwriter David Seville, and despite a poor house wrecking first impression, they impress him with their singing talent. Seeing the opportunity for success, both human and chipmunks make a pact for them to sing his songs. While that ambition proves a frustrating struggle with the difficult trio, the dream does come true after all. However, that success presents its own trials as their unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke, plans to break up this family to exploit the boys. Can Dave and the Chipmunks discover what they really value amid the superficial glamor around them?"

2369932,plot,"Till Reiners, mid-30s, has been a teller at Osthofen Mutual Bank for almost 15 years, leading a settled, regular life. His marriage to ambitious purse designer MIRIAM is happy, but in danger of getting into a rut after all those years of harmony. The die hard hard rock lover's life is not exactly exciting, except for when his 4-year-old son has a crying fit because he lost his favorite snuggle bunny. All of a sudden, Till is torn from his daily routine when a bank robber storms his branch and takes Till hostage after his getaway car breaks down. When the kidnapper takes his mask off, Till recognizes NAPPO, a former con who just got out of jail and wanted a loan from Till to buy a new car the other day, but Till turned him down for professional reasons. As the police set up roadblocks and Miriam awaits her husband's call, Nappo decides to abandon Till in the trunk of the car the next morning and disappear with his loot. But it doesn't work out that way. Till and Nappo have to flee together. Pretty soon, Till has had enough. He summons all his courage and demands to call his wife, but the call turns into a fiasco. Due to a misunderstanding, Till gets the impression his wife doesn't care for him at all. Completely confused after this phone call, Till throws caution to the wind and dives into adventure with his kidnapper, Nappo. The odd couple even discovers a shared passion, their mutual love for hard rockers ""Donar"". Till really starts having a good time when he's able to use his banking skills to arrange an extremely lucrative deal for Nappo. More and more, Till relishes the gangster life and his newfound freedom, which takes him across the border to Holland. Little does Till realize the police are already treating him as a suspect and accomplice in the bank robbery. Miriam refuses to believe her husband is in cahoots with the gangster, and sets out for Amsterdam to find her husband without the help of the police. However, Miriam winds up in danger due to the shady deal Till has arranged. Her husband, meanwhile, has realized his old, ""square"" life maybe wasn't so bad after all, and has to risk all to rescue his beloved wife in a dramatic showdown."

2081944,plot,"""Fathers"" is the story of two single fathers and their sons. One of the men, Rick Tarinno, lost his wife in a tragic car accident 3 years ago. Ever since the accident, Rick has blamed God for everything, from the death of his wife to the living hell that his life has turned into. He turned to a life of abuse and drinking to try to drown his sorrows. The other man, Michael Campbell, is approaching the three year anniversary of the abandonment of his wife and subsequent divorce. The night she left was the same night as Rick's accident. Mike is a blue collar guy that really had to learn to be a parent after the divorce. He turned to his church family and friends for support and help and they led him to God, his ultimate helper. Rick's son, Lucas, and Michael's son, Raymond, have known each other most of their lives. Since the death of Lucas' mom, things haven't really been the same. Lucas has been the victim of his fathers' abuse and has turned to a new group of friends for the attention that he isn't getting at home. Raymond, the star quarterback on the high school football team, has been trying to maintain their friendship, but can do nothing but watch as his lifelong friend slips lower and lower. Rick's lack of faith, Michael's commitment to God, and Raymond's longing for his old friend will all be put to the test when Lucas is put in the toughest situation of his young life and Raymond is forced to fight for his. Only then will the truth be sought and hopefully found, before it's too late. ""Fathers"" is an exciting adventure into the spiritual journey of four men searching for their place in the world."

For ten-year-old Frederike (10) October 1989 gets off to a disastrous start: her beloved Uncle Mike (27) is expelled from the GDR and has to leave the country within 48 hours. Inspired by her big idol Captain Kirk, Frederike and her friends Jonathan (10) and Fabian (10) construct a teleporting machine to ""beam"" herself to West Berlin to visit her uncle Mike. But the experiment dramatically fails. Instead of successfully beaming the three kids across, the entire village population disappears! For a moment it seems that Frederike and her friends are the last remaining kids on earth. But TV proves what Frederike had immediately suspected: they have managed to beam everybody but themselves to West Berlin. They witness on TV how their families and friends desperately try to climb back over the Wall to their home country. Only quick thinking and action can undo the experiment and prevent the worst from happening before the border guards open fire. A race against time and the nasty local policeman Mauder begins."

There he plays his impressive and rare collections of records, mostly for himself and with some disregard for his audience. Jules Deelder provides us with an interesting view on jazz when it was at its popularity peak. This is inter-cut with interviews of his closest friends, colleagues, musicians and contemporary poets. The essence of Jules Deelder, a man of many words but one whom is hard to understand/grasp, is best captured in the dramatically styled 8mm black an white footage used in the film."

2261623,plot,"""Lance, Bruce: Illusionist (the Story of Bruce Lance the Illusionist)"" is a mockumentary following the astonishing rise to fame of a rogue magician whose edgy and shocking approach has revitalized magic's waning popularity, while raising the ire of the traditional magic community. A filmmaker follows Bruce for several weeks, capturing footage of several 'event appearances' including his inappropriate set at a kid's birthday party, his defiling of a bride at an Irish wedding, and his 'misunderstood' performance at an Armenian banquet. The director also takes us to the home of 'The Amazing Gweneveve,' Bruce's former assistant who longs for a reunion with her former master, despite the loss of a limb during their last performance. We hear from Bruce's fans and contemporaries a mix of disturbing admiration and impassioned resentment. The director also sits with Bruce, to delve into the mind of this unique performer. Is he a genius, or an amphetamine-dependent waste? Behold, the enchanting, dismal world of Bruce Lance."

2677897,"alternate versions","-Minor Spoilers* The film was dramatically reworked for the international version (ie. American release) due to pressure by its distributor who felt the stars needed to appear before their original appearance nearly 35 minutes into the film. Under supervision by the director Michael Petroni, the entire film structure has been altered using some unused footage (that doesn't otherwise appear in the original Australian cut) and trimming nearly 5 minutes of footage in order to introduce the adult Sam character (Guy Pearce) at the beginning of the film rather than a half and hour into it. Flashbacks are then implored from the original 35 minutes of the Australian cut for the Young Sam and Silvy scenes. Additionally, Dale Cornelius' original music score has almost entirely been replaced by an orchestral score written by Amotz Plessner. The results ultimately lead to two very different approached to the material with different tones. The original, director intended, version plays more like a romantic drama with a past/present connection whilst the international cut has been reworked to play more as a mystery with possible supernatural undertones. - End Spoilers *"

1968384,trivia,"'Rouzbeh Rashidi' (qv) made this film with a low budget and total cast and crew of four people including the actors. Intentionally working without a script or any kind of written pre-planning, Rouzbeh Rashidi constructed Closure Of Catharsis around an improvised monologue by actor 'James Devereaux' (qv), which took place on a park bench in Hackney's London Fields."
1968384,trivia,"'Rouzbeh Rashidi' (qv) did not arrange any kind of rehearsal and gave only the briefest of instructions to the actor; ""you're struggling to remember something, something from the past which you have repressed because of it's traumatic effect upon you, and the memory can be true or false, or a mixture of both"". The improvisation took place over two hours without any break, and Rashidi did not attempt to direct or shape 'James Devereaux' (qv)'s performance in the traditional sense, in-fact Rashidi was not even present for much of the improvisation, instead, he would deliberately wander off for 20 or 30 minutes at a time, allowing James to simply respond to his immediate situation in the park; a couple of unleashed dangerous dogs, a squirrel darting across a branch, a jogger crusing by, some school girls giggling at the camera, all became grist to the improvisational mill. Rashidi's only interjections were as an occasional mysterious off-camera ""other"", stimulating James by giving him random objects found in the park, such as an old pendant or an empty bottle of vodka. Aside from this however, Rashidi left James to his own devices in-front of camera, the only boundary being the frame within which James had been placed, and sometimes not even the frame, as when he stepped outside of it."

2698441,plot,"The Yakuza, Japan's organised crime syndicates, are a dying breed. Their members are aging and the government of Japan has launched a large-scale crackdown on them to eradicate them once and for all. But who are the Yakuza? The cancer of a nation or a necessary evil in a country with one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world? Undoubtedly the Yakuza are involved in crimes including extortion, fraud, murder, drugs and gambling. However, Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the industrialised world, with crimes related to drugs - officially against the Yakuza code of honour - or street gangs strikingly low, a fact that many contribute to the presence of the Yakuza. Deeply rooted in Japanese society, they are seen as a necessary evil and 'problem solvers'. They have been around since the 1700s and were said to protect the weak from the strong, following a rigorous code of honour. Several clans even contributed aid for the victims of the recent earthquake and Tsunami, all reasons why the public perception of the Yakuza in Japan is not solely a negative one. Unlike the Mafia, the Yakuza is a legal, public group making them relatively easy to check on. Their offices are public, their members registered by the police and Yakuza members went as far as freely admitting their guilt in cases of crime investigations, as a part of their code of honour. In reaction to strict government measures against them, the Yakuza has ceased all cooperation with the law. As the police concentrate their resources on the Yakuza, many criminals simply don't register with clans anymore and start operating underground, evading the grasp of police. A clear trend is emerging towards a new structure of organised crime in Japan, resulting in a steep decrease in the numbers of the traditional Yakuza while the underground is soaring - including foreign Russian and Chinese mafias. This documentary deals with the struggle of the Yakuza for its survival and the restructuring of the organized crime scene in Japan. Furthermore, unprecedented access to the secret world of the Yakuza gives you an insight on who the Yakuza really are: criminals, outcasts, but also family men and a part of Japanese society."

2353198,plot,"This is an auto-biographical reflection into my battle with a medical diagnosis I received 11-months ago at the age of 25; I have a rare brain tumor and it's causing me to have severe grand-Mal seizures. For my safety and health it was decided that the tumor needed to be surgically removed by way of craniotomy, with the hopes that it could help curb the severity of my seizures, if not make them go away completely. This film is my artistic and cathartic exploration into my feelings regarding this harrowing time, and how it has effected and changed me forever."

Ogston compiles interviews with all surviving band members and a wealth of rare archival footage, including Skeptics' controversial 'AFFCO'' video - which cut too close to the bone for TVNZ - and their remarkable, emotional final live performance in 1990. Singer David D'Ath died just weeks later, following a short battle with leukemia. His death signaled a premature end for the band but not their music, which is widely regarded as some of the best to have come out of New Zealand. Like Skeptics' music, Sheen of Gold is an intensely personal and rewarding experience."

2616458,trivia,"At one point Mr. Incredible calls his family life ""My greatest adventure."" That was the title of a DC Comics series called ""My Greatest Adventure"" which was most famous for featuring the four-member superhero team the Doom Patrol which has a member named Elastigirl, although her power is to alter her size, not stretch."
2616458,trivia,"The unusual architecture in the film was based on a distinctive style of 1950s space-age futurism known as Googie, most often seen in coffee shops and bowling alleys of the era. Tiki architecture, another 1950s pop style and often considered a form of Googie, is also exemplified in many of the island sets."
2616458,trivia,"'Brad Bird (I)' (qv) has stated that the movie is in part inspired by the comic books of 'Jim Steranko' (qv), whose work on ""Nick Fury: Agent of SHIELD"" tackled a similar spy/espionage genre."
2616458,trivia,"The handwritten text that zips by sideways at the beginning of Mr. Incredible's footage interview reads: ""Pixar Animation Studios production \#50840: The Incredibles, reel 1AB."""
2616458,trivia,"This was the first film by Pixar whose lighting was designed with LPICS, a design technology developed in-house. With it, lighting designers could view and make lighting changes, and it would take a tenth of a second to show the new image. Previously, it took 2000 seconds to do the same task."
2616458,trivia,"SPOILER: Helen got the jet from Snug, her old sidekick and pilot when she was Elastigirl. Originally, Snug would have also flown the plane and gotten killed when it was shot down, thus raising the stakes for the characters. The animators convinced 'Brad Bird (I)' (qv) to have Helen fly the plane herself, rather than spending money on a minor character for only a few minutes of screen time. The shot of Helen watching the destroyed plane sink into the ocean was apparently filmed when the script still called for Snug's death, explaining her overlong look as the wreckage sinks because, as filmed, it contained the corpse of her friend."
2616458,trivia,"When Buddy first meets Mr. Incredible, he has put on a hero mask and filled in the area around his eyes with a blue marker. A similar technique was used in all the Batman films to make the eyes of the actor more visible against the black mask."
2616458,trivia,"When Mr. Incredible is called into Mr. Huph's office, at one point Mr. Huph places his hand on a piece of paper. Judging from Mr. Incredible's expression, it seems like this paper is a termination notice. Actually, it is a memo to all employees, letting them know they will be responsible for buying all of their office supplies. It also states that parking will be metered by the hour, and that their electricity usage will be deducted from their paychecks. The letter concludes by saying that Insuricare has ""recorded its highest profits in years."""
2616458,trivia,"All four wall clocks in Mr. Huph's office show exactly the same time (clocks mounted in this manner typically show the time in different time zones)."
2616458,trivia,"In the teaser trailer, a small headline at the top of the framed TV Guide on Mr. Incredible's wall reads, ""Kevin O'Brien: First Artist on the Moon."" 'Kevin O'Brien (V)' (qv) is a storyboard artist for the movie."
2616458,trivia,"As with other Pixar productions, the original trailer for this film featured animation made specially for the trailer and not appearing in the final film. It was directed by 'Brad Bird (I)' (qv) 18 months before the release of the movie."
2616458,trivia,"To record the 'Henry Mancini' (qv)- and 'John Barry (I)' (qv)-inspired jazz-orchestra score, composer 'Michael Giacchino' (qv) eschewed modern digital multi-track recording and returned to the analog recording methods used for jazz-orchestra recordings in the 1960s. ""We were just like, 'Forget that, let's throw everyone in the room, let's pretend we only have three microphones, and let's get it right. Let's just do it.'"""
2616458,trivia,"'John Barry (I)' (qv) was originally hired to score the film in his James Bond-style, but left the project after recording only a few demo themes; some were used for theater trailers."
2616458,trivia,"When Elastigirl is attempting to discern the location of Mr. Incredible in the island's command center, you see her looking at an energy consumption grid. You then learn that Mr. Incredible is on Level A1, in Cell Block 13, or A113. Previously in the film, Mr. Incredible has a meeting in Conference Room A113 before the second Omnidroid fight. A113 is a frequent Pixar in-joke based on one of the room numbers for the animation program at Cal Arts."

2616458,trivia,"Inside Robert Parr's cubicle is a danger sign. The image is the lightning bolt of DC Comics's Captain Marvel (SHAZAM!) using the red of his uniform instead of the gold. It is in the distinctive shape of the Marvel family (Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Black Adam), not that of the various Flash costumes. When Mr. Incredible gets his new fancy car, the emblem on the hood is in the triangular shape of the Golden Age Superman symbol. The black ray-like vehicle that delivers Mr. Incredible to the island is a reference to the Black Manta, an enemy of Aquaman and member of the Legion of Doom.

When he later left 20th Century Fox, Lasseter asked again but Bird turned him down again as he had a contract with Warner Brothers to make _The Iron Giant (1999)_ (qv). However, when Warners failed to properly promote the film, Bird finally agreed to join Pixar. Lasseter had only one request for his friend: make the film you've been dying to make. As Bird had been sitting on the idea of making a cartoon about a family of superheroes for over a decade, ""The Incredibles"" was the natural choice."

2616458,trivia,"'Brad Bird (I)' (qv) drove his teams hard to be as creative as possible, insisting on greater attention to details and characters than any other previous Pixar production.

2616458,trivia,"Clothing, with its textures, weaving and stitching, is notoriously difficult to achieve in computer simulation. Given that there are over 95 different outfits worn by the characters in the film, a tailor was brought in to the studio to explain the intricacies of clothes design."

2616458,trivia,"There are strong similarities to another family of super-heroes: Marvel Comics' The Fantastic Four. Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr) has super-strength like the Thing (Ben Grimm); Elastigirl (Helen Parr) is able to stretch her body like Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards); Violet is able to turn invisible and project force-fields like the Invisible Woman (Susan Storm Richards); and baby Jack-Jack briefly shows an ability to turn himself into living flame like the Human Torch. Jack-Jack bears an even stronger resemblance to Reed and Susan Richards' son Franklin, a mutant with the power to alter reality. Like Bob and Helen Parr, Reed and Susan Richards are husband and wife, and have children with powers. Like Violet and impulsive Dash Parr, Susan and the impulsive Johnny Storm are elder sister and younger brother. The costumes of the Incredibles are red unitards with black collars, trunks, gloves and boots with an ""i"" emblem in the chest area. The costumes of the Fantastic Four are blue unitards with black collars, belts, gloves, and boots with a ""4"" emblem in the chest area. Both sets of costumes are made to adapt to the wearer's specific powers and abilities. The super-villain that appears at the end of the movie calling himself the Underminer is a dead ringer for The Mole Man, a longtime foe of the FF, and the image of the first FF cover is briefly mimicked. In fact, makers of _Fantastic Four (2005/I)_ (qv) were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to the storyline of The Incredibles."

'Lee Unkrich' (qv) has confirmed that the truck does not appear."
2616458,trivia,"Bollywood superstar 'Shah Rukh Khan' (qv) felt compelled to dub his voice for the Hindi version because his son 'Aryan Khan' (qv) was so impressed by a preview of the original movie. Aryan Khan also lent his voice to the character Dash Parr, son of Mr. Incredible. Actress 'Negar Khan' (qv) voiced Mirage and funny man 'Javed Jaffrey' (qv) voiced Syndrome. The dubbed Hindi version and the original English version were released simultaneously on 17 December 2004 in India, and distributed by SPE Films."
2616458,trivia,"The Parr family's original car resembles a 1950s Nash. Bob's new car is essentially a combination of a 1960s Jaguar E-Type (the front), has a hood logo resembling the Lotus logo, and the back end is basically from a 1963 split-window Corvette."
2616458,trivia,"The first two trailers released on the internet features (a slightly modified version of) the cover version 'The Propellerheads' (qv) made over the theme from _On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)_ (qv).

2616458,trivia,"Quite a lot of German movie-goers were convinced that the look of Mr. Huph was based on actor and comedian 'Herbert Feuerstein' (qv), who provided the voice of Huph in the movie's German version and who is a dead ringer for his on-screen alter-ego. According to Feuerstein, though, he was cast because he ""looked the part""."
2616458,trivia,"Right before Mr. Incredible beats up the guards in order to escape the island, you see them watching footage of the city being destroyed by Syndrome's robot. As one of the guards pops open a bottle of champagne, you hear him say, ""Every time they run, you take a shot..."" - they are making up a drinking game based on the robot's destruction."
2616458,trivia,"As of 2012, the only Pixar movie to win an Academy Award for a category other than Best Animated Picture (Best Sound Editing)."
2616458,trivia,"The stained glass window above the entrance to the church where Bob and Helen get married resembles the I on Mr. Incredible's original blue costume."
2616458,trivia,"'Jason Lee (I)' (qv) was cast as Syndrome on this strength of his performance as Azrael in _Dogma (1999)_ (qv)."
2616458,trivia,"When Bob goes to the kitchen to get another plate for Dash, he is reading a newspaper. Across from the page with the story about Simon J. Paladino disappearing, there is a story with the headline ""Crime Scene Reveals No Clues"". The first sentence of the body of the story reads: ""Last night's shootout was no accident. Several men were seen pointing weapons of mass destruction at each other's county's."" The rest of the story is about Insuricare and their policy of never paying out on policies."
2616458,trivia,"When Dash and Helen are in the car on their way to Violet's school, Helen tells Dash that everyone is special. His reply, ""That's just another way of saying nobody is,"" mirrors a later quote from the villain Syndrome: ""And when EVERYBODY'S super...no one will be."""

2616458,plot,"Bob Parr (A.K.A. Mr. Incredible), and his wife Helen (A.K.A. Elastigirl), are the world's greatest famous crime-fighting superheroes in Metroville. Always saving lives and battling evil on a daily basis. But fifteen years later, they have been forced to adopt civilian identities and retreat to the suburbs where they have no choice but to retire of being a superhero and force to live a ""normal life"" with their three children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack (who were secretly born with superpowers). Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top secret assignment. He soon discovers that it will take a super family effort to rescue the world from total destruction."
2616458,plot,"Mr. Incredible is a superhero; or he used to be, until a surge of lawsuits against superheroes submitted by the people they've saved forced the government to hide them in witness protection programs so they could lead normal, anonymous lives. Now known exclusively by his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen, formerly Elastigirl, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, and he's fed up with his pushy boss and his immoral profession, but his wife's worked too hard to build a normal life for her family to abide his nostalgia for heroism. When Mr. Incredible's offered the chance to play the role of hero again by a mysterious informant, he jumps at the opportunity, but when it turns out to be a trap set by an old nemesis he had a hand in corrupting, the whole family must reveal themselves to save Mr. Incredible and countless innocents."
2616458,plot,"Fifteen years ago, superheroes walked the streets of Metroville, performing acts of great heroism and inspiring many to follow their example. But a string of lawsuits by disgruntled people they'd helped lead to political and public outcry, and the Supers were forced into retirement and government-funded anonymity. Bob Parr used to be Mr. Incredible, one of the greatest and strongest Supers; now, he lives a mundane life as a suburban insurance agent. Although his wife Helen (formerly Elastigirl) has moved on and is more concerned with raising their children Dashiell (who is super-fast and super-confident), Violet (who can turn invisible - and is super-shy) and baby Jack-Jack than battling evil, Bob still yearns for the good old days - and his chance comes when he is approached by a shadowy government organization and asked to join their numbers. But all is not as it seems, and Bob will find himself trapped by Syndrome, an embittered enemy who in his youth once idolized Mr. Incredible - and only his family will be able to save him now..."
2616458,plot,"Metroville was once flooded with superheroes saving the day. One of the greatest was Mr. Incredible, who found himself annoyed by the young chatterbox fanatic of his, Buddy Pine, who referred to himself as 'Incrediboy.' As Mr. Incredible fought crime, he met another legendary hero, Elastigirl and the two superheroes wed. shortly afterward, a string of lawsuits banned superheroes from ever saving the day again! 15 years later, Mr. Incredible, now known as Bob Parr is itching to become a superhero again. Mrs. Incredible, or Helen Parr, is trying to persuade him not to. Their son, Dash, who has the ability to run extremely quickly, wants to try out for sports, but he can't because of his powers being revealed. Violet, the Parr's daughter, wants to be normal and fit in as a teen. And the baby, Jack-Jack is only itching for a good time. Then, Bob hears about a top secret assignment regarding a powerful machine attacking Nomanisan Island. Thinking this is his way to become a superhero again, Bob accepts and yet again becomes Mr. Incredible...however, this anonymous villain has a grudge..."

2635906,trivia,"The film took approximately 20 days to shoot over several months due to budget restraints."
2635906,trivia,"Douglas Feary counted over fifty scratches and cuts on his body after filming the climax."
2635906,trivia,"Although the key actors were professionals, many of the supporting roles were played by locals living in Ceduna. To get the best performance out of them, Mathew J. Wilkinson encouraged them to drink on set to 'settle the nerves'."
2635906,trivia,"Director Mathew J. Wilkinson worked as a cleaner in order to finance the film."
2635906,trivia,"Considered an ""Ozploitation"" (Australian exploitation) picture."
2635906,trivia,"'Paul Hayman' (qv) put on weight to play the character of Cameron Betts."
2635906,trivia,"The film was written as a mockumentry because writer/director Mathew J. Wilkinson knew he would not have much money to work with. As a result the film has very little to do with the original hoax which occurred in the 1970s. Wilkinson however makes reference to the 1970s through a range of techniques including the opening credit montage and music, the lack of visual effects and the heavy referencing to Australian exploitation films which peaked during this era."
2635906,trivia,"To fit with the feeling of a Documentary there was never more than three crew members on set. There was only ever a Sound Recorder/1st AD, a make-up artist and a Director/Camera operator. At times Mathew J. Wilkinson was the only crew member as he found it difficult to get people to come out to such a remote area."
2635906,trivia,"Besides the night scenes, the entire film was shot with natural lighting. This was because of the lack of crew members on set. It is also justified on-screen when the Crew Member in the film holding the reflector goes missing."
2635906,trivia,"Became the fastest selling movie session in the history of Hoyts Cinemas in Australia, out-doing Twilight and Sex and the City 2 in just under twenty minutes."

Yet, Charlie seems to have a new found aversion to blood (thanks to a date gone terribly wrong) and through the sordid details he reveals to Carlo, he tries to convince his partner to take care of any dirty work if this job goes sour. They make it to their destination with only a few weird run-ins with strangely behaving pedestrians and confront Konstantin regarding the debt. As expected, the job becomes violent, but with a twist. It appears that Konstantin (through powers granted him by a magical ring) is able to control the undead. Charlie, weak in the knees at first, abandons Carlo to the horde of zombies before finally leaping at Konstantin and claiming the ring for himself. The film comes to a conclusion as the two hit-men are returned to the car. Charlie, the newly established King of the Undead, calls the previously mentioned girl to try again (his fear of blood conquered) while Carlo is revealed to be a newly made zombie."

Three stories of couples passion, jealousy, doubt and infidelity - couples that are burned by sudden and unexpected feelings and are pushed to make the decision that will change their lives, forever influenced by the events of September 11 in New York City. The first story is between Millo and his wife Luisa. He is a Double AA baseball player that has missed his opportunities because his father held him back waiting for something better. His anger has turned into jealousy and frustration that will burst out when a new scout appears in town to recruit players, shying away from Millo and offering him a coaching job instead. Millo's frustration makes him turn against everybody especially his wife whom he abuses physically, and the scout is the ultimate victim of his outrage. Luisa escapes to New York September 11. The second story is about a pilot who leads a double life as a married man with a daughter in Puerto Rico and a gay lover in New York, a flight attendant on his crew. His life will be turned upside down when his plane is redirected to Bermuda on his way to New York the morning of September 11. The third story is about Anhelo, mother of the flight attendant, who meets a younger man, a photojournalist and falls passionately in love with him, putting in jeopardy her reputation as an artist and her marriage of many years.

2525185,plot,"Aspiring writer Roth Monroe gets a lot more than he bargained for when he moves into his new apartment. From his window he witnesses his landlord, Hackworth Bianca, beat a man senseless, and subsequently dispose the man's remains in a series of garbage bags. What follows is a bloody series of events that Monroe photographs in hopes of exposing his bizarre landlord's murderous secrets. Monroe reluctantly involves his beautiful neighbor Miranda Page when he informs her of the landlord's recent activities, but his secret surveillance soon leads Monroe and his best friend Miles Wilson  into high stakes danger. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but in Monroe's case his snapshots lead to a shocking turn of events that changes his life forever."

2769957,plot,"The film begins with Riyaz (Rajat Kapoor), Zubeida's son setting out to research her life, and to meet the people who knew her. The story is thus told in the form of memories/reminiscences. Zubeida is a Muslim actress, who's career aspirations are thwarted by her film-producer father (Puri) who looks down upon a woman in acting. He arranges her marriage to her friend's son, but that breaks up after the birth of her son. Zubeida is now back at her parent's home, sad and depressed. Rose (Lilette Dubey) her father's mistress tries to cheer-up Zubeida by taking her out. On one of these outings, Zubeida meets Prince Vijayendra (Victor) Singh of Fatehpur (Bajpai). Quite taken with her, the Prince woos and marries her. Zubeida, now the 2nd wife of a Hindu prince, leaves her son behind with her mother (Sikri) and comes to live at Fatehpur. Here she meets the much older Mandira Devi (Rekha) the Prince's first wife, learns about the etiquette of being a Rani, and of the duties her husband has towards his first wife. Zubeida's relationship with Mandira (whom she calls Mandy didi) is tumultuous, seesawing between affection and jealousy. She frets about the restrictions on her as Rani and the choke-hold of royal duties on Victor, often venting out her frustrations at not having her husband to herself. When Victor decides to contest the elections, he relies on Mandira, as his Hindu consort (as opposed to Zubeida), to accompany him on his political jaunts. Zubeida, angry at being spurned, in obstinacy takes a decision, which has fatal consequences."

One in their group, Chloe, dies when a car hits her and then comes back to her friends as a ghost. Then, the girls realize that when one girl celebrates her 13th birthday, that girl can't see Chloe anymore. All the girls have to move on one by one, and the film dramatizes how this situation affects their friendships and Chloe's experience of becoming invisible. The climax of the movie occurs when Chloe, angry at being slowly left behind, uses her telekinetic abilities to destroy a building that holds memories from their childhood. The denouement involves the last girl to turn 13, just before her party, and Chloe appears to her for the last time, finally accepting of her fate. The final scene shows the girls the following spring, reunited to memorialize Chloe, and Chloe is sitting in a field close by, so there is a sense of resolution and hope. The title refers both to Chloe's literal disappearance, and to her friends, who are moving on from girlhood into adulthood. Most of the film's dialog was written or improvised by the actors, giving the film a naturalistic picture of adolescent life."

However, when a cloudy evening obscures her view, she ventures out into the garden to find her skyward friend. The aim of the film is to entertain and to tell a story, but I also want it to challenge how the medium of animation can affect the way we interact with a narrative. Created a picture book aesthetic by combining traditional drawn animation with digital compositing, whilst incorporating text into the design of the backgrounds in place of the usual film dialogue and narration."

Abstracted constructs, reassembled from 'automatic drawings' created before and after sleep, take form as separate parts - evolving from one state to another. Organic line vessels become glowing containers for fluid movement - reinforcing themes of stored impulses, muscle memory and lucid dreaming. Through the use of repetition, the viewer is forced to remain inside the loop - slowly becoming aware of what has passed and what is anticipated whilst experiencing a constant state of now. Finally the process of retrieval begins - rapid stop motion drawings are juxtaposed with mixed media collage representing the human form as it wakes from sleep."

One of those criminals, Python Diamond, is being flown back to Earth, escorted by five members of the military police. Upon their return to Earth, they find that a cataclysmic nuclear war has reduced the world to a near-lifeless husk. Searching for survivors and any clue as to the cause of the destruction leads the six to a warehouse bunker housing scientists who constitute Earth's last remaining hope for the future. Unfortunately, their landing spacecraft drew the attention of one of the gangs that roam the ruined countryside in search of food and resources, leading them straight to the carefully hidden and well-provisioned shelter. The gang lays siege to the warehouse, fighting their way inside in a bloody battle that takes lives on both sides."

2098262,plot,"Back in late 2005, 24 year old filmmaker Mark Jeavons set out to make an ambitious feature film called: 'Whatever Happened to Pete Blaggit'. Shooting on super 16mm with a small budget, Jeavons put together a talented cast & crew and cameras rolled in August 2006. It wouldn't be until November 2010 that the film would be finished, after four long years of blood, sweat and tears. 'Four Years, Two Wigs & One Fridge: the Pete Blaggit story' is a warts-and-all documentary, revealing the roller coaster ride of trying to get the film finished when it seemed all hope had been lost. Featuring interviews with Mark Jeavons, casting director James Booth and leading actors Rob Leetham and Andy Pandini, the documentary is a refreshingly honest and candid re-telling of the struggle to bring Pete Blaggit to the big screen.

Not really, since the majority of the people we are talking about are teachers, computer programmers, plain workers and old-age pensioners.

USED examines the scenario of what could happen if economic conditions continues to decline which in effect, weakens the structures that governs good behavior within our society. For example, what if we were forced to minimize the amount of policing that's necessary to maintain in an effort to cut back on government spending. Furthermore, what would happen if the solution to control the booming prison population and ease the burden on tax payers is to release violent and non-violent felons alike, the minute they become eligible for parole. Lastly, what actions will decent, hardworking civilians take in order to secure their safety and prosperity. This is where the 2nd Amendment comes in to play resulting in a vigilante society."

Man is forced to plan the largest operation in human history - finding solutions to living in space until being able to save what is left of Earth. Many enormous space station ships are built, to carry large populations. Among them is the tremendous mother ship, Embla. An unexpected explosion suddenly takes place that destroys extensive and essential parts of the mother ship and panic erupts among the people aboard; everybody is trying to get to the few remaining escape pods in order to save themselves and at least try to reach what's left of Earth. Two young women, Anno and Ona, manage to escape in a pod, and they begin a most daring journey, that will challenge them both emotionally and physically and with no guarantee of making it to Earth. They will experience what really makes us human."

2523637,plot,"Adapted from a short story by award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates, Small Avalanches is the gripping tale of a teenage girl's dangerous encounter with a middle-age man. Set in rural Ontario in the mid-1970s, Small Avalanches follows Nancy, a surly 13 year old as she tries to find something to do on a hot summer day. After pestering her mother for some change, Nancy heads to the rundown garage where her uncle works. She walks aimlessly around the car wrecks and gas pumps, and grumbles jealously about her cousin with a babysitting job. Finding no sympathy from her uncle, Nancy returns home in the suffocating heat along a deserted road. When she is accosted by a strange and aggressively charming man who follows her from the garage, the teenager becomes confused-at once intimidated and flattered by the man's attention. As his intentions become clear and his manner menacing, Nancy escapes the would-be molester by forcing him to chase her through the forest. Overcome by exhaustion from the chase, the man collapses and Nancy leaves, confused yet triumphant. Returning home to her shrill, hectoring mother, Nancy says nothing of her experience, knowing instinctively that her own vigilance and cunning are her only protection against the world's random dangers."

'Eva Green (I)' (qv) was supposed to lean forward and kiss Matthew goodnight but accidentally caught her hair on fire on the candle on the table. She didn't let it worry her and acted so natural that 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv) decided to leave it in as he felt it perfectly anticipated the theme that things are about to get a bit crazy."

2599157,trivia,"Director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv) was so impressed how the actors so naturally acted naked, he penned an uncredited lengthy extra scene in the script where all three main actors are overtly nude. It ended up on the cutting room floor."
2599157,trivia,"There were scenes in the script depicting much more blatant sexual relations between the characters of Matthew and Theo, but they were not filmed. Director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv) said, ""The gay sex was in the first script, but I had a feeling that it was just too much stuff. It became redundant."" Actor 'Michael Pitt (II)' (qv) said in an interview, ""It was in the script and it's what I'd signed to do. But they said we weren't going to do that."""

2599157,plot,"Paris, spring 1968. While most students take the lead in the May 'revolution', a French poet's twin son Theo and daughter Isabelle enjoy the good life in his grand Paris home. As film buffs they meet and 'adopt' modest, conservatively educated Californian student Matthew. With their parents away for a month, they drag him into an orgy of indulgence of all senses, losing all of his and the last of their innocence. A sexual threesome shakes their rapport, yet only the outside reality will break it up."
2599157,plot,"The tumultuous political landscape of Paris in 1968 serves as the backdrop for a tale about three young cineastes who are drawn together through their passion for film. Matthew, an American exchange student, pursuing his education abroad in Paris, becomes friends with a French brother and sister duo, named Theo and Isabelle, who share a common love of the cinema. While the May 1968 Paris student riots--which eventually shut down most of the French government--are happening around them, the three friends develop a relationship unlike anything Matthew has ever experienced, or will ever encounter again."

The chicken looks up excitedly, then eats the grain. When more grain comes down the chicken gets up and fervently pecking, follows the long trail of seeds. The spectator now sees an egg upon which the chicken had been sitting. A mosquito wearing a cap and a scarf lands on the unprotected egg and pierces the shell. With a squealing chirp the chick inside bursts upon the scene and sees the light of day. Without the mother in sight, the newborn chick starts staggering around, searching for food and warmth. Because of its lack of experience the chick gets into life-threatening situations, but it narrowly escapes each time. The chick meets an unscrupulous vulture ... makes friends with an exhibitionist snowman ... mistakes a sadistic bear for its mother ... and is preyed upon by a furious shark. As a last resort the chick jumps back into the nest for cover. Like at the beginning with its mother, a shadow followed by the strange flashing light brushes past the chick. With its last strength the chick lifts its head and looks around. New grains are lying scattered all over in the snow. Hungry for food the lucky chick starts pecking and leaves the nest again. A little further on its path is blocked by a large shape. The chick lifts it and continues its gluttonous journey ... The story ends in a very tragic way, when the camera moves back and the audience sees the whole scenery."

2520801,plot,"We all know what sex looks like. Many movies have tried to capture the magic, but most can only bring home the tricks. This movie allows you to participate where others leave you the unsatisfied peeping tom. It dares to share the slowness. In a unique twist, this film is edited in nearly real-time. As real-life couple Wim and Floor spend an afternoon in the sunwashed rooms of an old house in Belgium, the camera simply follows. In the slowness, we get the build, the sweetness, and the sexiness. Forget about fingersnapping fast editing. Slow is where it's at. This film was conceived as a feminist collaboration between erotic film director Jennifer Lyon Bell and artist/DJ/author/lingerie-designer Murielle Scherre, aka La Fille D'O. They created it for the feminist Stout(st)e Dromen Festival in Antwerp, Belgium."

2148368,plot,"Filmmaker Mark Cousins goes to Albania for five days, and films what he sees. He discovers that the movie prints in the country's film archive are decaying. In investigating this, Cousins begins to encounter bigger questions about the history and memory of a place. Perhaps a country whose 20th Century, dominated by its authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha, was so traumatic, should allow its film heritage to fade away? Perhaps a national forgetting should be welcomed? Influenced by the films of Chris Marker, Cousins' film broadens to consider the architecture of dictators and the great icon paintings of Onufri. In the past, when cartographers knew little about a country, they wrote on it Here be Dragons. Albania was, for decades, one of the least well know countries in the world. Cousins' road movie meditation takes the advice of Goethe: ""If you would understand the poet, you must go to the poet's land."""

These providers of services and goods often remain faceless and nameless. They are, like the people who enjoy their services, mainly migrants, but their presence here is more sharply defined by the lack of survival options back home. Nothing else explains why they should bear with such harsh living and unfair working conditions. The film will look at the crisscrossing of various lives in the filmmaker's housing colony, gleaning from this microcosm a sense of how millions work, interact and struggle for a firmer foothold in an indifferent, often hostile megacity."

2562630,trivia,"'Topher Grace' (qv) revealed that the heavy drug use in the film caused the delayed release. Grace and director 'Michael Dowse' (qv) wanted to ""do something that felt like it was literally made in the '80s"" and not a parody of that generation. Grace believed it wouldn't be the 80's without heavy cocaine use, so there was ""real hesitation"" on part of the studios. The film ended up sitting on the shelf until 'Ron Howard (I)' (qv) and 'Brian Grazer' (qv) of Imagine Entertainment came to the rescue.

2562630,plot,"It's the late 1980s, when Wall Street is riding high, and it seems as if the entire country is cashing in on the bumper profits. Disgusted with the materialism that surrounds him, Matt Franklin, a brilliant young MIT graduate, has walked out on his well-paid position at a local lab and taken a low-level job as a video clerk, much to his father Bill's consternation. And the crises keep piling up in Matt's life. His best buddy Barry has just gotten fired from his job, his brainy sister Wendy is getting hitched to her vapid boyfriend Kyle, and the gorgeous Tori Frederking, long-time object of Matt's unattainable adoration, is suddenly back in the picture. Now, on one wild, woolly and irresponsible evening, everything is coming to a head, with explosive results."
2562630,plot,"Summer is winding down in the San Fernando Valley, and so are the '80s. But on one final night during Labor Day weekend 1988, five friends' lives will intersect at an all-night party as they declare-for the last time before turning a corner into adulthood. MIT alum Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) was poised to make the most of the Me Decade. He should be in a corner office, starting his upward climb to full-fledged yuppie-hood. Instead, the directionless 22-year-old has taken a part-time job behind the counter of a Suncoast video at the local mall. But when Tori Frederking (Teresa Palmer)-the most popular girl from Matt's high school-walks into the store, he decides to take one last swing at greatness. With his twin sister, Wendy (Anna Faris), and their best friend, Barry (Dan Fogler), he rolls out for an epic end-of-summer party. We follow the trio as they say goodbye to the teenage friends and personalities that defined them. As the night wears on, Matt fakes an identity to impress Tori... Wendy faces a proposal from her high school sweetheart, Kyle (Chris Pratt) ... and Barry, having just been fired from his dream job of selling luxury cars, takes a walk on the wild side."

A young teenager, named Lindsey, thinks there is a connection of the events to Aidan, the outcast brother of the first suicide case. But Lindsay must race against the clock when she witnesses her mother fall victim, and must try to find a way to stop the curse before it kills her too. Meanwhile the God-fearing townspeople, led by a fanatic preacher with a connection to the events also, form a vigilante group to take the law in their own hands."

Given our status as a tiny Pacific nation, with an independent foreign policy, the film asks why we got involved. Were we being good global citizens or were we attempting to realign ourselves with the US given the past strains due to our anti-nuclear policy? We also explore the limitations of our embedded media coverage which was not just scarce but closely followed our Government's position that our role was largely humanitarian. Finally, the film reflects on indigenous issues and some of the conflicts Maori soldiers felt about participating in what increasingly appeared to be an occupation."

1874023,trivia,"Because the only remaining 8 gauge shotguns on the market were either too antique or too valuable to use, the movie's armorer, Gibbons Ltd., had to specially contract for replicas. Gunsmith Steve Karnes purchased three replica Colt 1878 shotguns and modified the barrels so that all three sets would have bore sizes equal to that of a real 8 gauge shotgun. The first two shotguns were designed to fire full-load 12 gauge blank rounds (one gun could be used while the other was cleaned or repaired from a previous film shoot.) The third shotgun was designed to chamber 8 gauge inert rounds, and was used for reloading scenes. All three were then given identical, 'aged' finishes, to make them appear old and used."
1874023,trivia,"When 'Ed Harris (I)' (qv) reloads his Peacemaker (Colt Model 1873 Single-Action Army Revolver), he realistically uses the pistol's ejector rod to push spent cases out of the cylinder. Since few actors in Hollywood actually know how to use the weapons they fire in movies, most don't know what the ejector rod is, and are seen in various westerns reloading SAAs by opening the loading gate and shaking the spent case out."

1874023,plot,"1882, New Mexico Territory. Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch are itinerant lawmen, hired by desperate towns as marshal and deputy. The city fathers of Appaloosa hire them after Randall Bragg, a newly-arrived rancher with money and a gang of thugs, disrupts commerce and kills three local lawmen. Cole and Hitch contrive to arrest Bragg and bring him to trial, but hanging him proves difficult. Meanwhile, a widow has arrived in town, Allison French, pretty, refined, and good-natured. Virgil falls hard, and it seems mutual, but there may be more to Allie than meets the eye. Can friendship and skill with a gun overcome a pernicious villain and green-eyed jealousy?"
1874023,plot,"The tough friends and partners Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch arrive in the town of Appaloosa and they are hired as marshal and deputy by the local politicians with absolute power to rule the city. In their first assignment, they face the gang of the powerful rancher Randall Bragg, who had killed Marshall Jack Bell and his two deputies, and they kill three gunmen. When the refined piano player Allison French arrives in Appaloosa, she stays close to the needy Virgil and they decide to live together. Meanwhile one employee of Bragg offers to testify against his boss and Virgil and Everett bring him to court, where he is sentenced to death by hanging. While transporting Bragg in the train to be executed, two gunmen abduct Allie to force Virgil to release the criminal. Bragg escapes with his men and Allie through the desert, with Virgil and Everett on their tail."

Terror, fear, insecurity, hunger has plagued Gjakova town located on the border with Albania. This does not exclude that along the narration the situations are built on a logic flow, moments of humor, eroticism, that occasionally avoid blackness of circumstances, which cross the theme of the film. The film initially develops in two parallel lines that then converge, connected to a common thread, where, at the end, each of the lines goes back to its own fate. It is a film for adults and children too."

One day a wealthy man brings a mentally challenged young woman named Pagli (madwoman) to serve in the temple to atone for the death of his abused wife. Pagla and Pagli both decide to get married, incurring the ire of the entire village. The Panchayat is asked to intervene and they decide to keep the two separate, which is not acceptable to both, and they run away to Bombay. Upon arrival, they are met there by Police Inspector Pardesi who sees tremendous potential in them for making some money for himself. He arranges to house them in an under-construction sky-caper, makes a temporary temple for them, and arranges for devotees to line-up, pay large sums of money and get their blessings. Pardesi, the devotees, pimps and others witness that whenever Pagla bangs the drum something happens to Pagli and she acts as though possessed, makes predictions, conjures miracles, death and destruction to enemies. What Pardesi does not know is that Pagla is just an alias for Shamsher Singh, a dreaded bandit, wanted for several murders, who may be abusing Pagli's sixth sense, and pretending to be a madman to elude the police."

1956276,plot,"Anna Foster has never had an ordinary life. At eighteen years old, she is the most protected girl in America; she is the First Daughter. Frustrated with her overprotective father, the President of the United States of America, Anna makes a deal with him: only two agents are allowed to guard her while she attends a concert in Prague. When her father backs out of his promise, Anna flies into a temper and goes on the run with Ben Calder, a handsome photographer she runs into outside of the music club. They travel together with the intention of going to the Love Parade in Berlin. Anna hasn't told Ben who she is but more importantly, Ben hasn't told her who he is. Under the orders of Anna's father, Ben is supposed to keep an eye on the rebellious girl but falling in love with her wasn't something he expected to do. Romance blossoms between the wild, sassy Anna and the cool, distant Ben as they backpack through Europe. Problem is, when it is time to go back and Anna finds out about Ben, what will happen to the two lovers?"
1956276,plot,"The President's daughter, unable to experience life like a normal 18 year-old, escapes from her entourage of Secret Service agents while traveling in Europe. She falls in love with a handsome British stranger, who also happens to be working undercover for her father. A modern-day homage to ROMAN HOLIDAY."

The film is Haitian-born film maker Jonas Nosile's gripping look into both Haiti's past and the state of the Haitian soul today. It also gives its audience a better understanding of the lack of infrastructure and political instability that has left Haiti so helpless and annihilated following the quake. The film traces Haitian history from its early successful struggles for independence through to its contemporary - less victorious - battles with poverty. Nosile poses tough questions about the degree of Haitian's responsibility for their dilemma. Will this island nation find a way to break with the legacy of its tragic past? Will the resilient spirit of her people be enough to overcome the obstacles and catastrophes facing the country today? The answers may surprise its audience."

Our armies drove the Frost Giants back into the heart of their own world. The cost was great. In the end, their king fell, and the source of their power was taken from them. With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home at the Realm Eternal, Asgard. And here we remain as the beacon of hope, shining out across the stars.

Next time with an army.::Thor: Exactly!::Loki: There's nothing you can do without defying Father. [Thor looks at Loki]::Loki: No! No, no, no, no!

You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach knowing that you could never lift it. The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.::Thor: Can I come home?::Loki: The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.::Thor: Yes, but... couldn't we find a way...?::Loki: And Mother has forbidden your return.

2673731,trivia,"'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) conceptualized this film as a Norse/comic-book twist on 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s _Henry V (1989)_ (qv), which was about a young king who underwent trials and tribulations: fighting a war, courting a girl from another land, trying to live up to the example set by his father (a beloved king), and basic character development."
2673731,trivia,"In 2005, 'Matthew Vaughn (I)' (qv) was going to direct this film, describing it as ""the birth of a hero, interweaving _Gladiator (2000)_ (qv) with Norse mythology."" He went on to direct the comic book films _Kick-Ass (2010)_ (qv) and _X-Men: First Class (2011)_ (qv) for Marvel, and _Stardust (2007)_ (qv) for DC Comics."
2673731,trivia,"Originally, the persona of Dr Donald Blake (Thor's alternate identity/personality) was going to be in the film, and 'Kevin McKidd' (qv) was considered for the part. However, Blake is used as a false identity for Thor."
2673731,trivia,"In the 1990s, 'Sam Raimi' (qv) had planned to direct this film after _Darkman (1990)_ (qv). He later went on to do _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv), another Marvel hero, and its sequels."
2673731,trivia,"In April 2006, screenwriter and ""Thor"" fan 'Mark Protosevich' (qv) wrote a script for the film, which he described as ""an Old Testament God who becomes a New Testament God."" However, the script was so laden with VFX-worthy sequences that it would require $300 million to film, so when 'Matthew Vaughn (I)' (qv) signed on, he rewrote and trimmed the script to bring the budget down to a more agreeable $150 million."
2673731,trivia,"'Jim Carrey' (qv) was a long-time favorite and candidate for the role of Loki since _The Mask (1994)_ (qv), which indirectly featured Loki (but put in more fame his magic powers). 'Josh Hartnett (I)' (qv) was also rumored for the role."
2673731,trivia,"'Brad Pitt' (qv) was rumored for the role of Thor; 'Channing Tatum' (qv) and WWE wrestler 'Paul Levesque' (qv) (aka Triple H) was considered for the part; 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) was the first choice; and 'Charlie Hunnam' (qv), 'Tom Hiddleston' (qv), 'Alexander Skarsg¿¿rd' (qv), 'Liam Hemsworth' (qv) and 'Joel Kinnaman' (qv) tested for the role, but finally Liam's brother 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) got the part."

Finally 'Josh Dallas' (qv) took the role."
2673731,trivia,"In December 2004, 'David S. Goyer' (qv) was in negotiations to write and direct the film."

2673731,trivia,"Around 2000, the film was going to be a made-for-TV special to be produced by UPN, and 'Tyler Mane' (qv) was approached to play Thor."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) was chosen after previously collaborating with 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) on the theatrical play 'Ivanov' and the TV series _""Wallander"" (2008)_ (qv)."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) initially auditioned for the role of Thor, but 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) felt he would make a better antagonist and cast him as Loki."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) described his role of Loki as ""a comic-book, but nastier version, of King Lear's Edmund."" In the 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv) play, Edmund was a prince who was jealous of his brother Edgar and tricked his father into banishing him into exile."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) prepared for the role by going on a strict diet before and throughout filming, so that Loki would have a lean but hungry visage."
2673731,trivia,"For his role as the warrior Volstagg, 'Ray Stevenson (I)' (qv) wore a specially designed fat suit that gave Volstagg a round but tough appearance: ""What we've done is kind of sex Volstagg up... he's got every bit of that Falstaffian verve and vigour, and a bit of a beergut to suggest an enormous appetite, but he's not the Weeble-shaped figure in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles!"""
2673731,trivia,"'Natalie Portman' (qv) took the role of Jane Foster because she couldn't resist the opportunity of a comic-book film directed by acclaimed director 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv): ""I was just like Kenneth Branagh doing 'Thor' is super-weird, I've gotta do it."""
2673731,trivia,"According to 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv), the film's biggest challenge was connecting the worlds of Asgard and 20th century Earth: ""It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film."""
2673731,trivia,"'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) has been a fan of ""Thor"" since childhood. When Marvel Studios selected Branagh as the director, they sent him the complete collection of the Marvel Thor comics series as reference material for the character."
2673731,trivia,"'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) claims he relates to his role of Odin: ""I'm a little like Odin myself. He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man, probably a chip off of the old block... but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it."""
2673731,trivia,"A model of the Destroyer armour was constructed for the film."
2673731,trivia,"CAMEO('Stan Lee (I)' (qv)): the creator of Thor in 1962, appears as the truck driver who attempts to tow Mjolnir out of the crater it landed in."

2673731,trivia,"SPOILER: In _Iron Man 2 (2010)_ (qv), Thor's hammer Mjolnir was first seen lying in a crater in New Mexico. This was based on the comics (Fantastic Four \#536), where in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event on Asgard, Mjolnir was cast out to land in Oklahoma, where it lay until Thor come to reclaim it."
2673731,trivia,"'Jaimie Alexander' (qv) had served on the wrestling team at her high school in her Texas hometown of Colleyville, so she says she had some experience in fighting to use in her role as Sif."
2673731,trivia,"'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) has had prior experience with wielding a hammer, having worked as a builder in Australia for a few years."
2673731,trivia,"According to 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv), the action coordinators experimented with different combat styles, but ultimately the fighting technique Thor utilizes is an original one, based on boxing: stance low to the ground, with big powerful hip movements."
2673731,trivia,"To prepare for the role of Thor, 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) put on a massive amount of build and weight, through a six-month regimen of trips to the gym and indulging in a massive diet of eggs, chicken, sandwiches, vegetables, brown rice, steak and protein drinks."
2673731,trivia,"The final choice for the role of Thor came down to brothers 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) and 'Liam Hemsworth' (qv).

2673731,trivia,"CAMEO('J. Michael Straczynski' (qv)): a writer who worked on the ""Thor"" comics, appears as the first person to try to lift Mjolnir."
2673731,trivia,"It's mentioned in passing that Thor's hammer was forged inside ""a dying star"". This actually makes a modicum of scientific sense. When a very large star dies in a supernova, sometimes its remains collapsed to form a ""neutron star"". These objects cram the mass of the sun into the size of a city, forming a new kind of matter nicknamed neutronium. A single teaspoon of this material would weigh billions of tonnes. If Mjolnir was made of this material, it would certainly explain its incredible weight."
2673731,trivia,"There is a billboard in the town advertising for New Mexico tourism with the slogan ""Land of Enchantment - Journey into Mystery"". ""Land of Enchantment"" is the nickname of New Mexico, ""Journey into Mystery"" is the title of the Marvel comic book where Thor made his debut (Journey Into Mystery \#83)."
2673731,trivia,"'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) asked 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) to improvise his reaction to Thor's yelling at him in the banishment scene. Hopkins agreed, and when the scene was filmed many of the cast/crew present were sobbing. 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) and 'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) later said they had to struggle to keep their composure during filming that scene. Hiddleston later complimented Hopkins, to which he said, ""Ken's fantastic, isn't he?""."
2673731,trivia,"This is 'Rene Russo (I)' (qv)'s first comic book film. She was previously considered for the role of Chase Meridian in _Batman Forever (1995)_ (qv), but was replaced by 'Nicole Kidman' (qv) when 'Michael Keaton' (qv) left the project and was replaced by the younger 'Val Kilmer' (qv)."
2673731,trivia,"The agent that grabs up a bow when Thor is attempting to recover his hammer is referred to as Agent Barton, and appears in the credits as Clint Barton. Clint Barton is the real name of Hawkeye, the archer hero in the Avengers comics."
2673731,trivia,"The film makes extensive use of actual Norse mythology (which the ""Thor"" comic was based on): - the war between the Asgardians and the Jotunns was based on the Aesir-Vanir war (the Jotunns were in fact a non-hostile/antagonistic race) - Odin's ravens Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who gather information in Midgard and relay it to Odin, are sitting on his throne during Thor's coronation ceremony - the Bifrost, originally thought of as the rainbow by the Norse, is seen as a beam of rainbow light. - when Odin appears in Jotunheim, he is riding his eight-legged horse Sleipnir - a Jotun calls Thor a ""little princess"" - once Thor's hammer was stolen and he dressed up as a Princess to go back and retrieve it - and Thor shows Jane a drawing of a crossroads with nine orbs in it - his perception and representation of Yggdrasil, a great tree around which the nine worlds are tethered, making up the universe."
2673731,trivia,"CAMEO('Walter Simonson' (qv)): a comic book writer/artist whose work on ""Thor"" was highly renowned and acclaimed, has a cameo appearance in the banquet scene near the end of the film, sitting between Sif and Volstagg."

2673731,trivia,"This is 'Natalie Portman' (qv)'s second comic-book film after _V for Vendetta (2005)_ (qv)."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) found Loki's helmet very uncomfortable, as it was heavy to wear and he couldn't see properly out of it. He channeled this discomfort into Loki's battle scenes."
2673731,trivia,"When 'Chris Hemsworth' (qv) and 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) saw each other in full armors for the first time, Hopkins said ""God, there's no acting required here, is there?"""
2673731,trivia,"'Colm Feore' (qv)'s makeup as Laufey the Frost Giant took five hours to apply."
2673731,trivia,"The film's portrayal of Thor combines the classic Marvel Comics character (Thor is cast down to earth to as punishment for his arrogance) with the Marvel ""Ultimate"" character (Thor is dismissed by many on earth as a crazy deluded man)."
2673731,trivia,"A model of the Infinity Gauntlet, an all powerful weapon capable of controlling aspects of reality (soul, time, space, power & mind) in the ""Marvel Comics"" universe, was constructed for this film. The model is made from bronze and copper (with jewels made from resin) and weighs 60 pounds. It was built to be operational so that animatronics could be built on it."
2673731,trivia,"To prepare for his role as Loki, 'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) trained in the Brazilian martial art of capoeira."
2673731,trivia,"'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) researched Marvel Comics' Loki and found him to be a multi-dimensional character, so based his performance as Loki on three different actors: 'Peter O'Toole (I)' (qv) (enigmatic reckless persona), 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv) (edgy and near-insane persona), and 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) (persona with simmering anger)."
2673731,trivia,"SPOILER: According to 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv), Odin runs the Marvel Universe. It was Odin who hid away the Cosmic Cube in _Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)_ (qv), and the Infinity Gauntlet in _The Avengers (2012)_ (qv)."
2673731,trivia,"'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv) signed on as Odin despite never reading a ""Thor"" comic or knowing anything about the Thor mythology. It was the concept of the father and son relationship that intrigued him about the role."
2673731,trivia,"Both 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) and 'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) were performing in a West End stage production of 'Ivanov' when it was announced that Branagh would direct this movie. At the 2010 Empire Movie Con, Hiddleston recalled one night when, as a joke, he burst into Branagh's dressing room wielding an empty plastic container from a water cooler like Mjolnir, shouting ""Come on, Ken, what do you think!?"". Brannagh's response was reportedly a very jokey ""You never know, darling, stranger things have happened"". Two months later, Hiddleston was auditioning for Thor, before landing the role as Loki."
2673731,trivia,"'Stan Lee (I)' (qv) claims he'd always wanted to play Odin, but was happy with 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv)'s casting and performance in the role."
2673731,trivia,"To prepare of the role of Fandral, 'Josh Dallas' (qv) drew inspiration from renowned swashbuckler 'Errol Flynn (I)' (qv) and his films: ""Flynn had a lot of that boyish charm that Fandral's got all that in him."" The comics' characterization of Fandral was also based on Flynn."

2673731,trivia,"'Colm Feore' (qv) described his role of Laufey as ""the 'Napol¿¿on Bonaparte' (qv) of Frost Giants"", and drew inspiration from 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv), 'Max von Sydow (I)' (qv) and 'Paul Scofield (I)' (qv) (it was originally going to be all Hopkins, but 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) said they didn't need two Hopkins in the film)."
2673731,trivia,"When 'Tom Hiddleston' (qv) learned he was going to be in the film, he was in ""a grizzly pub"" in North London, and caused an uproar there by screaming out loud."
2673731,trivia,"According to producer 'Kevin Feige' (qv), the Bifrost bridge is the films's most interesting set: ""In the comics, it's literally a rainbow that extends out from Asgard and pops down on Earth. We're not necessarily doing that; we're not having the big hard solid lines of colors. We're saying it's some sort of energy, almost a solid quartz bridge that as the light catches it and flows through it, you get some of that rainbow-esque quality to it."""
2673731,trivia,"The filmmakers cite the work/art of ""Thor"" writers 'Stan Lee (I)' (qv), 'Jack Kirby (I)' (qv), 'Walter Simonson' (qv) and 'J. Michael Straczynski' (qv) as an influence on the look of the film."
2673731,trivia,"SPOILER: Jane Foster is seen wearing a special top when the Destroyer attacks; on it is a sun partially covered with a thundercloud. This foreshadows the return of Thor's power."
2673731,trivia,"This is 'Anthony Hopkins (I)' (qv)'s first comic book film (_The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv) is debatable). He was previously offered the role of Alfred in _Batman Begins (2005)_ (qv)."
2673731,trivia,"According to 'Don Payne (IV)' (qv), Jane Foster was more of a stereotypical scientist (dry and skeptical), but 'Natalie Portman' (qv) wished to revise the character to make her more poetic: ""She thought Jane could be someone who thinks outside of the box, someone whose theories are considered outlandish and are frowned upon by the scientific community. But it's the kind of thinking that leads to great discoveries. When Thor arrives, she's willing to take a leap of faith - and she has to pay the consequences for it."""
2673731,trivia,"According to 'Kevin Feige' (qv), the filmmakers placed the 'Foo Fighters' (qv) song ""Walk"" in the film because they thought its lyrics were strangely appropriate for the film: ""If you asked two months ago if we would have a Foo Fighters song in this movie, I would have said I don't think so. But we heard the song, and it just has these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes. Ken in particular just loved it with these lyrics about learning to walk again and the way that fit the themes of the movie about redemption, learning to be a hero."""
2673731,trivia,"SPOILER: 'Samuel L. Jackson' (qv) describes his Nick Fury post-credits scene as ""connective tissue to _The Avengers (2012)_ (qv)."""

2673731,trivia,"According to 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv), the closing credits sequence was based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope and took 18 months to create."

2673731,trivia,"The Earth town where most of the film is set is named ""Puente Antiguo"", which means ""old bridge"" and could be hinting at the Bifrost using it as a frequent destination point."
2673731,trivia,"When the Destroyer appears on Earth, the SHIELD agents speculate that it could belong to Tony Stark (Iron Man). In the storyline 'Fear Itself', Tony Stark acquired Destroyer armour from Asgard."
2673731,trivia,"In the film, the casket of Ancient Winters was held by the Frost Giants of Jotunheim; in the comics it was held by the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, in particular their leader Malekith the Accursed. In the film Loki holds the Casket and asks Odin if he is accursed, in homage to Malekith."
2673731,trivia,"The Science & Entertainment Exchange collaborated with the filmmakers on the film design and production with three physicists (Sean Carroll, 'Kevin Hand (V)' (qv) and Jim Hartle, as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson) to provide a realistic scientific background for the film. This collaboration resulted in changing Jane Foster's profession from nurse to physicist, and used the terminology ""Einstein-Rosen bridge"" (named after 'Albert Einstein' (qv) and Nathan Rosen) to describe the Bifrost."
2673731,trivia,"Mjolnir is ancient Norse for ""crusher."""
2673731,trivia,"Thor refers to Agent Coulson as ""Son of Coul,"" misinterpreting his surname as ""Coul's Son,"" in the way Norse cultures construct surnames (John's son becomes Johnson, etc.)."
2673731,trivia,"This was the first film to get theatrical release AFTER it was released on home video in Indonesia."

2673731,trivia,"When Thor's silhouette is seen in the lightning storm photographs, a variety of film equipment can be seen such as a 2K tungsten light and a waveform monitor."
2673731,trivia,"SPOILER: In Norse mythology, Laufey is Loki's mother, not his father. This change made by the filmmakers was found amusing in Iceland since Laufey is still a popular female name there."
2673731,trivia,"As Thor is leaving the restaurant to go to the crater site and Jane follows him, you can see a small water tower at the end of the street that says ""Welcome. Home of the Vikings."""
2673731,trivia,"According to 'Tadanobu Asano' (qv), he is of part-Norwegian descent and so he felt it was a ""necessity"" for him to work on a film based on Norse mythology."
2673731,trivia,"In Norse mythology Thor's nickname was ""protector of mankind"" (which is apt, considering Thor's superhero status today). Scandinavians until this day wears mjolnir-amulets, refereed to as ""torshammare""."
2673731,trivia,"When Dr. Selvig is in the library looking at the book of Norse Mythology, there is an illustration of Odin walking across the Bifrost bridge with his Gungir spear in one hand and the Tesseract in the other. In _Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)_ (qv), the Red Skull mentions that the Tesseract was the jewel of Odin's treasure room."
2673731,trivia,"Dr Selvig mentions a comrade who got mixed up with SHIELD, whom he described as ""a pioneer in gamma radiation""; this alludes to Bruce Banner, whose experiments in gamma radiation mutated him into the Incredible Hulk.

They are, in chronological appearance: - the Orb of Agamotto, - the Tablet of Life and Time, a slab that can extend one's lifetime - the Eternal Flame, - the Eye of Agamotto, - the Casket of Ancient Winters, a enchanted container filled with frosty winds; plays a major role in this film. - and the Infinity Gauntlet, a glove encrusted with six reality-bending jewels (later seen in _The Avengers (2012)_ (qv)), only seen briefly when the Destroyer attacks the Jotun thieves."
2673731,trivia,"'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) was inspired to do the scene where Odin rips off Thor's chestplates from _The Life of Emile Zola (1937)_ (qv), where a disgraced army officer was stripped of his rank."

Floating garbage and dirty surroundings are already part of their community. What they are scared of is a mysterious creature living beneath the water. Just recently, this creature killed an 8 year old child who is swimming in the water. Despite this danger, the children are still at risk of doing things normally. As for Totoy, 11 years old, he must not be picky every time he dives in to the water to gather plastic bottles. For every scrap of garbage he collects is the food for him and his father. The Parkner's disease of his father made Pirot, 10 years old dive into the water to search for pieces of metal and fish for an everyday living. At his young age, Pirot's dream is to uplift his family from poverty by means of diving. Totoy and Pirot are just one of those children who do work at a very young age in Puting Bato Island."

'I know for sure it will never reach its destination.' WHITE ELEPHANT is a documentary about the Central Post-Office and its employees in Kinshasa, DR Congo. This grandiose relic of the colonial past has trapped its employees in a frozen timewarp from which they are planning their escape. From past to present, through the cracks in the walls, and leaks in the ceilings, we glimpse present-day Congo."

2195965,plot,"Off the coast of Baja, Mexico, 210 miles south of San Diego, California, a remote island serves as one of nature's dwindling sanctuaries to a fearsome ocean predator - the Great White Shark. In a race against time, eco-tourists and marine researchers from the United States and Mexico have forged a unique alliance to gather scientific data in the hopes of protecting these animals from potential slaughter. This is a countdown, a countdown to survival at Isla Guadalupe - the Island of the Great White Shark. With these opening words, RTSea Productions' documentary, Island of the Great White Shark, begins the first comprehensive examination of Isla Guadalupe, its population of great white sharks, and the ongoing scientific research taking place there. Several compelling concepts are brought together in this production: the wide range of research techniques being employed, the kinds of data being gathered, the unusual working relationship between shark researchers and eco-tourism operations, and of course the sharks - both feared and misunderstood by the general public while also highly vulnerable and threatened with possible extinction."

It focuses on the economic crisis and how it has affected a wide variety of people and situations in this quiet and usually calm country. The desire was to tell the story of the tormented country through a new type of narrative. Through a process of creative collaboration and documentation, a group of 14 photojournalists and videographers, were mentored, enabling them to make the transition to a multimedia storyteller. 'Krisis' is the synthesis of these different stories into a feature documentary that explores how Greece and the Greeks are handling the crisis. In addition, The Prism and Krisis are testaments to how creativity is the best antidote to the crisis, and that innovation can occur in the darkest of hours."

The Nazi shadow has darkened the Jewish view of Jesus for too long. Now you can hear/read the stories of Jewish men and women who survived the Holocaust and found amazing hope and healing in Jesus."
2555655,plot,"Holocaust survivors give their amazing true life accounts, telling how they clung to life amidst unimaginable horror and loss. Most amazing of all, these ""survivors"" did more than survive. Despite the darkness they endured, they found light and hope-from a most unlikely source."

Strong friendships evolve quickly, the bonds deepening with every step. Seemingly insurmountable obstacles defeat some but leave others yet more determined to continue. Powerful emotions are unleashed as tensions run high, but laughter is never far behind the tears. The many stories that unfold provide a powerful insight into the climbers' emotional and physical journeys as they struggle with the challenge of a lifetime. Emmy award winning cinematographer, Gordon Brown, directed by Kyle Portbury and supported by Gregory Rinaldi (producer) and Kate Coggins (editor), climb as part of the team, creating a feel that is up close and personal as well as epic. Renowned composer, Michael Price, draws inspiration for the score from the developing narrative and extraordinary backdrop. And by the time the summit comes into view, it is clear that there is nothing to differentiate the climbers with disabilities from the other team members. This amazing journey of the spirit shows us that it is often our hearts and minds rather than our bodies that limit all of us. The Mountain Within is a testament to the incredible generosity of numerous organizations and individuals who donated their funds, resources and time. It is also a testament to Enham, the UK charity that organised the climb, who give those with disabilities opportunities to make real choices in life."
